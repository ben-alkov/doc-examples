The code ***created by the Hermeto team*** in this repo is donated to the public
domain.

NOTE CAREFULLY that most examples in this repo use code from 3rd-party projects[1]
which each have their own license statements, in which case said licenses apply
to the 3rd-paty code used. Nothing about said 3rd-party code or licenses applies
to, or changes the donation to the public domain of, the Hermeto team's own work.

[1] In general, we do not change the code of 3rd-party projects, to the extent
possible, to enable hermetic builds using Hermeto.
